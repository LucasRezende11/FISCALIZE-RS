## Description
The FISCALIZE RS is an initiative aimed at democratizing access to municipal management information and strives to provide an overview of municipalities, allowing individuals to actively exercise their citizenship and oversee whether the municipalities are fulfilling their basic and constitutional duties. Through the tool, users can access socioeconomic information, municipal public accounts, and indicators of key sectors such as health and education.
Furthermore, it seeks to highlight the importance of proper management of public resources and investments in health, education, and sanitation, with the goal of promoting comprehensive development.

It was developed in Python and utilizes the Streamlit platform for visualization and deployment. Therefore, the final form of the project is a Streamlit app.

## Databases
The databases used aim to provide an extensive overview of the socio-economic situation of the city being searched, enabling users to effectively monitor and assess it.
Among the primary data sources utilized, the SIDRAPY API stands out as a key provider of economic data from the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). Additionally, a custom Python script was developed for web scraping to collect data that was not accessible through API integration or available in standard database formats such as Excel.
Another important data source was the website of the Tribunal de Contas do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, which provided comprehensive information on municipal revenue, expenses, education, health, and expenditure limits.
The IBGE CIDADES platform, an IBGE tool for accessing their data, was also used to gather information on the Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica (IDEB) and mortality rates.
More information about the sources of information or the concepts that balizaram the construction of this tool is avaible in the references page in the app (Referências).
